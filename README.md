# UsbShutdown
an anti-forensic tool that shuts down your windows based computer when an usb device is attached
# Why?
Some reasons to use this tool:
In case the police or other thugs come busting in (or steal your laptop from you when you are at a public library, as happened to DPR). 
The police/FEDS commonly use a  mouse jiggler  to keep the screensaver and sleep mode from activating in conjunction with a usb tool COFEE that copies all contents to a usb flashdrive.
 You donâ€™t want someone to add or copy documents to or from your computer via USB.
 You want to improve the security of your (encrypted) home PC
# warning windows is inherently insecure and should be avoided if at all plausable
sadly sometimes that's not the case, this is where this tool fits in, to make an insecure platform just a tad bit more secure 
i make no promises with this software and it should be considered for educational purposes only
