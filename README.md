# UsbShutdown
an anti-forensic tool that shuts down your windows based computer when an usb device is attached
# Why?
Some reasons to use this tool:
In case the police or other thugs come busting in (or steal your laptop from you when you are at a public library, as happened to DPR). 
The police/FEDS commonly use a  mouse jiggler  to keep the screensaver and sleep mode from activating in conjunction with a usb tool COFEE that copies all contents to a usb flashdrive.
 You donâ€™t want someone to add or copy documents to or from your computer via USB.
 You want to improve the security of your (encrypted) home PC
